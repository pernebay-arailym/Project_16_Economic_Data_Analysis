# Economic Data Analysis FRED API Integration

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of economic data, leveraging the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. The analysis aims to explore various economic indicators and their trends over time. Key Python libraries used in this project include:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Plotly**: For data visualization.
- **FRED API**: To fetch real-time economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) system.

## Conclusion

The notebook serves as a robust tool for analyzing and visualizing economic data sourced from the FRED API. It highlights the process of:
- Setting up API connections.
- Retrieving and exploring diverse economic datasets.
- Creating dynamic and static visualizations to interpret economic trends.

This project provides a foundation for further economic research and can be extended to include additional datasets or more complex analyses. It is particularly useful for economists, data analysts, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of economic indicators over time.
